#Bank Churn Analysis & Forecasting
This project seeks to analyze a dataset of bank churners to identify key factors driving client attrition, develop predictive models to forecast churn, and provide data-driven recommendations to help the bank retain its clients. 

## Why Analyze Churn?
- Retaining clients is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
- Insights from churn analysis can help businesses reduce revenue loss.
- Predictive models can enable proactive retention strategies, improving client satisfaction and loyalty and thus lowering the probability of churning.

### In this project, we will consider and possibly provide answers to questions such as:
1. **Who is at risk of churning?**
2. **What kind of factors influence churn?**
3. **How do churn patterns vary across different demographics?**
4. **What kind of steps can the bank follow to avoid and reduce churn?**

Some advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will be used to analyze the data; rest assured their relevance and propriety to this data will be documented at length in addition to explaining any applicable formulae.
